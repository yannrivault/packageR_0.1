	abstract = {By nature, healthcare data is highly complex and voluminous. While on one hand, it provides unprecedented opportunities to identify hidden and unknown relationships between patients and treatment outcomes, or drugs and allergic reactions for given individuals, representing and querying large network datasets poses significant technical challenges. In this research, we study the use of Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies for identifying drug-drug interaction (DDI) information from publicly available resources, and determining if such interactions were observed using real patient data. Specifically, we apply Linked Data principles and technologies for representing patient data from electronic health records (EHRs) at Mayo Clinic as Resource Description Framework (RDF), and identify potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs) for widely prescribed cardiovascular and gastroenterology drugs. Our results from the proof-of-concept study demonstrate the potential of applying such a methodology to study patient health outcomes as well as enabling genome-guided drug therapies and treatment interventions.},

BioPortal enables community participation in the evaluation and evolution of ontology content by providing features to add mappings between terms, to add comments linked to specific ontology terms and to provide ontology reviews. The NCBO Web services (http://www.bioontology.org/wiki/index.php/NCBO\_REST\_services) enable this functionality and provide a uniform mechanism to access ontologies from a variety of knowledge representation formats, such as Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) format. The Web services provide multi-layered access to the ontology content, from getting all terms in an ontology to retrieving metadata about a term. Users can easily incorporate the NCBO Web services into software applications to generate semantically aware applications and to facilitate structured data collection.},

We have published the RDF version of all these ontologies at http://sparql.bioontology.org. This dataset contains 190M triples, representing both metadata and content for the 300 ontologies. We use the metadata that the ontology authors provide and simple RDFS reasoning in order to provide dataset users with uniform access to key properties of the ontologies, such as lexical properties for the class names and provenance data. The dataset also contains 9.8M cross-ontology mappings of different types, generated both manually and automatically, which come with their own metadata.},

Ontologies, which logically represent entities and relations in specific domains, are the basis of LD.

Ontobee is also the default linked data server for publishing and browsing biomedical ontologies in the Open Biological Ontology (OBO) Foundry (http://obofoundry.org) library. Ontobee currently hosts more than 180 ontologies (including 131 OBO Foundry Library ontologies) with over four million terms. Ontobee provides a user-friendly web interface for querying and visualizing the details and hierarchy of a specific ontology term. Using the eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) technology, Ontobee is able to dereference a single ontology term URI, and then output RDF/eXtensible Markup Language (XML) for computer processing or display the HTML information on a web browser for human users. Statistics and detailed information are generated and displayed for each ontology listed in Ontobee. In addition, a SPARQL web interface is provided for custom advanced SPARQL queries of one or multiple ontologies.},

	abstract = {The DBpedia community project extracts structured, multilingual knowledge from Wikipedia and makes it freely available on the Web using Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies. The project extracts knowledge from 111 different language editions of Wikipedia. The largest DBpedia knowledge base which is extracted from the English edition of Wikipedia consists of over 400 million facts that describe 3.7 million things. The DBpedia knowledge bases that are extracted from the other 110 Wikipedia editions together consist of 1.46 billion facts and describe 10 million additional things. The DBpedia project maps Wikipedia infoboxes from 27 different language editions to a single shared ontology consisting of 320 classes and 1,650 properties. The mappings are created via a world-wide crowd-sourcing effort and enable knowledge from the different Wikipedia editions to be combined. The project publishes releases of all DBpedia knowledge bases for download and provides SPARQL query access to 14 out of the 111 language editions via a global network of local DBpedia chapters. In addition to the regular releases, the project maintains a live knowledge base which is updated whenever a page in Wikipedia changes. DBpedia sets 27 million RDF links pointing into over 30 external data sources and thus enables data from these sources to be used together with DBpedia data. Several hundred data sets on the Web publish RDF links pointing to DBpedia themselves and make DBpedia one of the central interlinking hubs in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. In this system report, we give an overview of the DBpedia community project, including its architecture, technical implementation, maintenance, internationalisation, usage statistics and applications.},
